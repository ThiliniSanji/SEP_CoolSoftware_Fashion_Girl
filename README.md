## Features

### Search By Image

Client-Side (JavaScript):

1. User Input: The user selects an image file from their device using an HTML file input element.
2. Image Processing: Once an image is selected, JavaScript reads the image file and converts it into a Base64 encoded string. Base64 encoding represents binary data (like images) as a text format suitable for sending it through an HTTP request. Since we cannot pass image to celery we use string representation of the file.
3. AJAX Request: The JavaScript code sends an AJAX request to a specific URL on the server, defined as `/search-by-image/`. This request carries the Base64 encoded image data in the request body.

Server-Side (Django):

1. Receive Image Data: The Django view function receives the AJAX request containing the Base64 encoded image data.
2. Process Image: Using the model hosted in the replicate computing platform the model extracts the caption using the trained model.
3. Search for Similar Products: The text data which is extracted using machine learning model is  used to search for products in our database that are visually similar.
4. Return Search Results: The view function sends a JSON response containing details of the matching products, including title, price, and potentially image URLs (if stored separately).

Client-Side (Response Handling):

1. Receive Response: The JavaScript code receives the JSON response from the server.
2. Parse Results: The response data is parsed to extract information about the matching products.
3. Display Results: The JavaScript dynamically generates HTML content displaying the retrieved products. This involves creating product cards with titles, images, and prices. If no matching products are found, an appropriate message is displayed.

Benefits:

- Simplified Product Search: Users can find similar products without manually entering text descriptions.
- Improved User Experience: Provides a more intuitive way to search for visual items.
- Accessibility: Can be helpful for users who have difficulty describing products in words.
